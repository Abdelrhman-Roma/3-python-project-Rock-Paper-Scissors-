# 3-python-project-Rock-Paper-Scissors-
A simple interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors game built in Python. Users can play against the computer, choose the number of rounds (best of 3, 5, 7, or 9), and track scores until a winner is declared. This project demonstrates Python basics, loops, conditional statements, functions, and the use of the random module.
